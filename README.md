# Valentine Cat Proposal 💘🐱

This is a fun and interactive web project that playfully asks:  
**"Will you be my Valentine?"**  

With each click of the **"No"** button, the image of a sad (but cute!) cat changes and the messages get more dramatic — until you're compelled to say **"Yes"**. When you finally do, you're rewarded with an adorable celebration.
